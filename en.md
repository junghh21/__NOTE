Dear Mr. Dante,
Thank you for your email.
As the President of the Korea CFP Association, I was delighted to engage in discussion regarding the future of the Korean CFP system with you, the esteemed President of the International FPSB.
Although we aimed to respond promptly to your kind correspondence, certain unforeseen circumstances caused a delay. I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and hope you can appreciate our situation.
I have been made aware that, in addition to our meeting, you had the opportunity to meet with other key figures in the Korean FPSB during your visit in early March. I understand that you were briefed on a matter of great interest to the International FPSB by the litigation counsel of the Korean FPSB. I can confirm that the meeting agenda was shared with me prior to your visit and that you requested the content of our discussions be kept confidential, a request which I am sure was extended to others you met with.
However, I am now writing to bring to your attention an unfortunate development. It has come to my knowledge that a lawyer associated with the Korean FPSB, Mr. Hyung-Sang, submitted an email from you, received on March 13, 2024, as evidence in a lawsuit. I have attached the relevant documentation for your review (please see the attached file).
I would greatly appreciate your insights and guidance on this matter and welcome your thoughts.
1. I wanted to express my deep disappointment in the actions of the Korean FPSB. They have breached the trust extended to them by you and Ms. Christine P. Searls, as well as the other attendees of the meetings on March 7th and 8th.
I have been informed that the Korean FPSB has submitted, as evidence in the current lawsuit, details of the International FPSB meetings held on March 7th and 8th. This is in direct contradiction to the assurances of confidentiality you requested, and also to your statement that the "International FPSB has no right to interfere in the affairs of a member FPSB."
The email submitted as evidence includes specific opinions regarding the governance of the Korean FPSB, which seems to directly oppose the intentions you expressed in your communications with us.

I would like to inquire if you gave the Korean FPSB, or their legal representatives, permission to use your email as evidence in this way. If so, what reasons were given for doing so, especially considering the contrary instructions given to me and my organization? If you did not grant such permission, I would greatly appreciate your guidance on how we should proceed in response to this action by the Korean FPSB.


I wanted to bring attention to a matter of concern regarding the potential misrepresentation of the International FPSB's and your position on the Korean FPSB to the Korean legal system and the community of Korean CFPs.

The recent submission of your email to Korean FPSB's legal counsel, Mr. Hyun-Sang, on March 18, 2024, without including your response to his inquiries, raises questions about the context in which you provided your thoughts. Furthermore, it has come to my attention that they have also submitted an email from Christine P. Searls, Chief Legal Officer of FPSB LTD, to Ms. Haesook Yu, General Manager of FPSB Korea, dated November 27th, 2023, under the title "RE: FPSB Korea Governance Assessment." Once again, the Korean FPSB has submitted only a one-sided view, omitting the email response from Ms. Yu.
I believe that this selective submission of evidence risks misrepresenting your original intentions and those of the International FPSB to the Korean court and our community.
I would appreciate your insights into how we might address this situation to ensure that your position, and that of the International FPSB, are accurately conveyed to all relevant parties.

I wanted to assure you that the issues currently faced by the Korean FPSB are being addressed appropriately and through the proper channels by the Korean CFPs, the relevant officials within the Korean FPSB, the Korean judicial system, and the Financial Services Commission. I can confirm that progress is being made in resolving these matters.
You and the International FPSB can rest assured that these situations are being managed effectively.

Next year, it will be 25 years since the CFP system was introduced in Korea.
Since its establishment, Korean FPSB has operated well, despite some big or small challenges along the way. However, after the appointment of Chairman Kim Yong-hwan in September 2018 and the appointment of Vice Chairman Cho Sung-mok, who was recommended by Kim Yong-hwan, in April 2019, it has been in turmoil. Moreover, neither of them had any connection to the CFP industry before coming to the Korean FPSB. As a result, they made several mistakes due to their lack of understanding of the CFP system and the FPSB. The biggest was the annulment of the FPSB General Assembly, which was an outrageous and gross misconduct, and the Korean judiciary ruled that the FPSB management was wrong. Instead of holding a normal general meeting immediately after the Supreme Court ruling on February 23, 2023, Kim Yong-hwan and Cho Sung-mok illegally held a board meeting on February 24, 2023, the day after the Supreme Court ruling, to elect full members who supported them, and then held a general meeting in March 2023, in an attempt to change the governance structure of the FPSB to their liking. The Korean courts have responded by placing these individuals and the board members they recommended under direct suspension. Their continued illegal actions are making it difficult for the FPSB to get back on track. However, we have faith in the justice and wisdom of the Korean judiciary, which is why we continue to work through with the Financial Services Commission and the legal system to resolve issues whenever they arise. We kindly request that international FPSBs, including Mr. Dante, trust the Korean judiciary and government and remain neutral in the matter of the Korean FPSB.

Otherwise, there is a risk that some staff members of the Korean FPSB, including Kim Yong Hwan, Cho Sung Mok, and Yoo Hye Sook, will continue to convey distorted realities to the International FPSB and distort your opinions, which will in turn be conveyed to the Korean judiciary and others. 
This behavior defames the reputation of CFPs and ultimately undermines the development of the CFP system in Korea. We hope that the International FPSB, including Mr. Dante, will not take this risk.

We wish CEO Dante and the FPSB all the best for the future.
Thank you.

Best Regards, 
Youngkyu Chae, President of the Korea Federation of Professional Accountants
